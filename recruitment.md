# Recruitment

**WE NEED YOUR HELP!**

Now the recruitment bit ðŸ™‚ To make this happen we certainly need more new talent! Please consider dropping us a line if you would like to try out for the team in the following capacities if your profile matches:

**Asset creators**: you are detail driven, accuracy matters to you, you are strong in HP/LP baking workflows for current generation PBR engines, you are familiar with Substance Painter.

&#x20;                     \-> Hard surface: Weapons, objects, architecture, attachments etc.

&#x20;                     \-> Uniforms, gear -> Marvelous Designer knowledge is a big plus.

**Texture artists**: you are detail driven, accuracy matters to you, perhaps you do not model yourself but are able to turn HP/LP models of others into stunning artwork in Substance Painter.

**Animators**: you are familiar with skinning and animations in any tool that is able to export to Enfusion (max, blender, maya etc.). This involves both hard surface (weapons/vehicles) animation as well as characters.

**Producers**: help our team inject the assets into the game, configure the models, produce copy, zero the sights etc. This helps us enormously! Especially if you are a bit familiar already with Enfusion Workbench.

**Writers**: do you have some experience in developing exciting stories? Especially if you have experience in writing for games.

**Documentalist**: do you enjoy technical documentation? Help us keep the mod translated and documented on this site.&#x20;
