## Operations

The device can be turned on in two ways: `FIRE` and `ON`. When using `FIRE`, the device will turn on momentarily according to the selected mode and will switch off immediately. This can be used to give a quick signal to friendly forces.

When turning the device `ON`, the selected illuminator mode will be enabled. The device will always **turn off automatically after 5 minutes**. Turning the device `OFF` will disable all the illuminators.

A green LED on the back of the device will indicate that the device is turned on. The LED will also blink with accordance with the set IR illuminator frequency.
