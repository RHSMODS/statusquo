# AN/PEQ-16A

The AN/PEQ-16A is a military-grade laser aiming module designed for use with firearms. It is primarily used by the United States military and law enforcement agencies. The AN/PEQ-16A combines a visible red laser, an infrared laser, and an infrared illuminator into one compact unit, allowing for accurate aiming and target acquisition in a variety of lighting conditions. It also features a remote pressure switch for ease of use and can be mounted to a variety of weapons using its built-in Picatinny rail mount.

## Operations

The device can be turned on in two ways: `FIRE` and `ON`. When using `FIRE`, the device will turn on momentarily according to the selected mode and will switch off immediately. This can be used to give a quick signal to friendly forces.

When turning the device `ON`, the selected illuminator mode will be enabled. The device will always **turn off automatically after 5 minutes**. Turning the device `OFF` will disable all the illuminators.

A green LED on the back of the device will indicate that the device is turned on. The LED will also blink with accordance with the set IR illuminator frequency.

## Modes

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** IR lasers and illuminators can only be seen with appropriate optical devices, such as night vision goggles and scopes.

The AN/PEQ-16 can be set to the following modes:

| Mode | Name        | Description                                                                                  |

| D    | Dual        | Normal flashlight and visible laser.                                                         |
| L    | White Light | Normal flashlight                                                                            |
| A    | Aim         | Visible light laser                                                                          |
| AL   | Aim Low     | Low gain IR laser                                                                            |
| DL   | Dual Low    | Low gain IR laser, low gain IR illuminator (flashing in accordance with frequency setting).  |
| AH   | Aim High    | High gain IR laser.                                                                          |
| DH   | Dual High   | High gain IR laser, low gain IR illuminator (flashing in accordance with frequency setting). |

You can use the selector to set the mode before turning the device ON or during operation.&#x20;

## IR Illuminator Frequency

The IR illuminator can be set to pulse at specific frequencies:

* Continuous
* 1 Hz
* 4 Hz
* 8 Hz

## Inspection actions

Most actions like for eg turning device On/Off or switching modes can be done via radial menu that by default can be brought up by holding \[**\\**] key.

Due to some limitations action that allows user to adjust illuminator cone angle is only available through traditional inspect action (or while device is on the ground) which users can get to by pressing \[**Ctrl**] + \[**R**]. From there user has to select that option by using \[Scroll]. In order to adjust the angle user has to hold \[**F**] and \[**Scroll**] just like it is in case of BTR viewport hatches.
