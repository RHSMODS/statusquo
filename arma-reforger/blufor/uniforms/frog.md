# FROG

FROG stands for "Fighting Utility Uniform, Green." It is the official uniform of the United States Marine Corps. It was introduced in the 1990s as a replacement for the woodland camouflage pattern uniform and is now used as the standard combat uniform of the USMC. The FROG uniform consists of a green shirt and trousers made from a durable, rip-stop fabric, and features multiple pockets for carrying equipment. It is designed to provide Marines with a functional and practical uniform for use in various combat situations.

The FROG uniform is made of a lightweight, breathable fabric that is resistant to rips and tears. It is designed to be comfortable to wear in hot and humid environments, while also providing adequate protection in combat situations. The uniform includes several pockets for carrying equipment and ammunition, and is also equipped with Velcro panels for attaching rank insignia, unit patches, and other identifiers. The uniform can be worn with a variety of footwear, including combat boots and desert boots. In addition to its utility and functionality, the FROG uniform is also designed to be aesthetically appealing, with clean lines and a professional appearance. It remains an important part of the USMC's uniform regimen and continues to be updated to meet the changing needs of modern warfare.

The FROG uniform uses the Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform (MCCUU) camouflage pattern, which is a green and tan disruptive pattern. The MCCUU camouflage pattern is designed to provide effective concealment in a variety of environments, including desert, woodland, and urban settings. The pattern uses a mix of large and small shapes to break up the wearer's outline, making it more difficult for the enemy to identify the individual. The MCCUU pattern has been in use by the USMC since 2002 and remains the standard camouflage pattern for the USMC's combat uniform.

The FROG uniform is also commonly known as the MARPAT (Marine Pattern) uniform, in reference to its distinctive camouflage pattern, which is known as the Marine Pattern (MARPAT). This name emphasizes the unique and proprietary nature of the uniform and its camouflage pattern, which were developed specifically for use by the United States Marine Corps. The MARPAT uniform is an important symbol of the USMC and its heritage, and is worn with pride by Marines around the world.
