# AN/PVS-14

The AN/PVS-14 is a multi-purpose night vision monocular developed by the United States military. It's part of the AN/PVS series, with the PVS standing for "Portable Visual Search." This series is used by the U.S. military and by other nations and organizations for a range of applications, including tactical operations, surveillance, and navigation.

The AN/PVS-14 uses light amplification technology to enable the user to see in low-light or nighttime conditions. It works by gathering ambient light, such as moonlight or starlight, and amplifying it to create a visible picture. This device can also work with an infrared (IR) illuminator in total darkness, where no ambient light is available.
