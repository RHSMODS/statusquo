| Power and channel knob | By rotating this knob you will be able to turn on the radio and set it to custom channel. Every position on knob is saving settings chosen from MENU. |
| Battery                | While operating radio you will notice that it drains battery. You will be able to change battery once you will have spare one on your inventory.      |
| Keypad                 | Is used to program and navigate on radio's menu and interact with it.                                                                                 |

| INTERACTION THROUGH THE UI | Until now if you used \[G]+\[R] it would say that it turned on the radio where in fact the radio would remain off and it wouldnt allow you to recieve or transmit any data... That chagnes with this update as not only you will be able to turn your radio ON or OFF with \[G]+\[R] but through the \[G] menu you will be able to chane current knob position using \[Scrollwheel] which in vanilla radios is used for frequency adjustment but dont worry as there are new ways for doing that, more on that later..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| RADIO SCREEN               | Showing you the current radio settings and choose frequencies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| MENU NAVIGATION            | Due to change the of functionality of \[PRE+/-] keys it was necessary to move menu navigation to \[ARROW LEFT/ RIGHT] which are also used for selecting predefined options                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| PRESETS                    | Since this update we separated KNOB positions from frequency PRESETS... this was done to prepare for upcoming content... with this shift comes change to how we use 152 as from now on buttons \[PRE +/-] are used for switching between presets which allows you to change what preset is used by currently selected knob position... when switching between presets there will be now a number changing next to active transmitter as it indicates what preset is selected... with that comes ability change what preset is assigned to currently selected knob position by usage of \[PRE+/-] keys                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| NEW PRESETS                | By default 152 will have 5 presets that each will be assigned to corresponding knob position but with new menu position \[NEW PREset] you will be able to create up to 10 presets for all you comms needs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| FREQUENCY ADJUSTMENT       | until now you would either use \[G] menu with your scroll wheel or \[PRE+/-] to adjust your radio frequency but now you will be doing that through usage of \[ARROW LEFT/ RIGHT] (when not in the radio menu) which will change the frequency by currently selected value specified in \[FREQuency RESolution] menu which allows you to adjust that value... Second way to change frequency is to manually input it through new menu position \[PREset FREQuency], here when you enter input mode you will be able to use radio keyboard to input new frequency for currently selected preset... additionally while we're here you can change currently selected preset and adjust it frequency without leaving the menu by using \[PRE+/-] buttons, this functionality is avialable for some other positions as well and you can recognise that by the fact that menu position will have letter 'P' with a number of currently selected preset on the left side of it |
| ENCRYPTION                 | Since the introduction of new presets we made it so each preset has its own encryption key that can be set via \[CUSTom KEY] menu and applied when given preset is selected... In addition to that when you apply new custom encryption key it will also switch usage of custom key for that preset which previously would have to be done separately through \[ENCryption KEY] menu which now is primarily used for switching it back to the default encryption key and for security reason it will also wipe previously entered encryption key... same as \[PREset FREQuency], for those options you can switch to different preset by pressing \[PRE+/-} keys and adjust its encryption without leaving the menu...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
