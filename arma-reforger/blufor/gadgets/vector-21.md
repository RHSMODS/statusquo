| Press and hold **`R` ** key. Hold target for \~2 seconds in red targeting square. Release **`R`** key.                                    | Measures distance in meters to target.                              |                                         |
| Press and hold **`V` ** key. Hold target for \~2 seconds in red targeting square. Release **`V`** key.                                    | Measures azimuth in degrees to target.                              |                                         |
| Press and hold **`R+V` ** keys simultaneously. Hold target for \~2 seconds in red targeting square. Release **`R+V`** keys.               | Measures distance in meters and azimuth in degrees to target.       |                                         |
| Press and hold **`R`**, tap **`C`** to mark first point, move to second point and release **`R`**                                         | Measure distance between 2 points.                                  |                                         |
| Tap **`R`** once, press and hold **`R`**, tap **`C`** to mark first point, move to second point and release **`R`**                       | Measure horizontal and vertical distance between 2 points.          |                                         |
| Tap **`V`** once, press and hold **`V`** for \~2 seconds and release.                                                                     | Measure azimuth and inclination to a point.                         |                                         |
| Tap **`R`** once, press and hold **`R`** for \~2 seconds and release.                                                                     | Measure horizontal and vertical distance to a point.                |                                         |
| Press and hold **`V`**, tap **`C`** to mark first point, move to second and release **`V`**.                                              | Measure distance and azimuth between two objects.                   |                                         |
| Tap **`V`**, press and hold **`V`**, tap **`C`** to mark first point (original target), move to second (arty impact) and release **`V`**. | Measure fall of shot between target and arty impact for correction. | ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/image.png) |
