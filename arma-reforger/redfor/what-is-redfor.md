# What is REDFOR?

REDFOR is a military term that stands for "Red Force". In military simulations and wargames, the term is used to refer to opposing or enemy forces, as opposed to friendly forces (BLUFOR or "Blue Force"). The use of different colors to designate friendly and opposing forces is a common practice in military training and helps to distinguish between friendly and enemy forces for better organization and coordination during exercises. In this context, "REDFOR" refers to the opposing or enemy forces that are simulated as part of the wargame or training exercise, while "BLUFOR" refers to the friendly forces that are participating in the simulation.

In the context of RHS: Status Quo, Red Force has been chosen to represent the Russian Federation and its Allies.
