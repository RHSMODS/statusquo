The menu automatically scans the compatible devices and their actions. Use the default **`\`** key (press and hold) on keyboard or **`RShoulder+DUp`** on consoles to activate the menu and if any compatible devices are found, the menu will appear. The first menu will let you select the device and drill down to the actions of sub-actions of that device.
