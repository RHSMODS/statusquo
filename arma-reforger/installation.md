The experimental version is primarily intended for the RHS team to perform MP playability tests before stable releases and thus, at the moment, do not have official changelogs published.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
The experimental version can contain features that can cause serious problem and should not be used on servers that want to guarantee stability.
{% endhint %}

The experimental version is a preview of the next stable version and follows the same linear development branch.
