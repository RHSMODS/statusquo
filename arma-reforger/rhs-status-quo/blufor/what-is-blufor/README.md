# What is BLUFOR?

BLUFOR is a military term that stands for "Blue Force". In military simulations and wargames in the West, the term is used to refer to friendly forces, as opposed to opposing forces (REDFOR or "Red Force"). The use of different colors to designate friendly and opposing forces is a common practice in military training and helps to distinguish between friendly and enemy forces for better organization and coordination during exercises. In this context, "BLUFOR" refers to the friendly forces that are participating in the simulation or wargame, while "REDFOR" refers to the opposing forces that are simulated as the enemy.

In the context of RHS: Status Quo, Blue Force has been chosen to represent the US and its Allies.
