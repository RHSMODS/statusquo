# USMC

The USMC stands for the United States Marine Corps, which is a branch of the United States Armed Forces responsible for providing power projection from the sea, using the mobility of the U.S. Navy to rapidly deliver combined-arms task forces. The USMC is trained and equipped to perform a variety of missions, including amphibious assaults, raids, and direct action warfare.

The United States Marine Corps was founded on November 10, 1775. It is the oldest and largest of the five branches of the U.S. Armed Forces and has a rich history of serving the country in times of war and peace. During the American Revolution, the Marines played a crucial role in several battles, including the capture of Fort Nassau and the Battle of Chesapeake Bay. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the Marines have served in numerous conflicts, including the Mexican-American War, the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and Operation Desert Storm. Today, the USMC continues to serve as a critical component of U.S. military power and is widely recognized for its courage, discipline, and professionalism.
