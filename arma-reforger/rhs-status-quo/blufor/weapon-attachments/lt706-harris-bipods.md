# LT706 Harris Bipods

**Overview:**\
The LaRue Tactical LT706 is a Quick-Detach (QD) swivel mount designed to improve the functionality of Harris bipods, specifically the BRM-S 6"-9" model. This mount allows for rapid attachment and detachment of the bipod to any MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail, providing enhanced flexibility, stability, and adjustability for precision shooters.

**Development & Background:**\
The LT706 QD mount was developed to address common issues with traditional Harris bipod mounting systems, such as loose attachment points and limited adjustability. By replacing the OEM stud attachment base with a custom low-profile chassis, the LT706 reduces potential failure points and lowers the overall height by 0.25 inches. The large rear tension knob allows shooters to adjust swivel resistance on the fly, making it easier to maintain a stable shooting position in dynamic environments. The combination of Harris BRM-S notched legs and the LT706 QD system results in a highly reliable bipod mount for professional marksmen.

**Service & Usage:**\
The LaRue Tactical LT706 QD mount, paired with a Harris BRM-S bipod, is widely used by precision shooters, military marksmen, and law enforcement snipers who require quick deployment and stable support in the field. The notched leg design prevents unintentional collapsing, while the quick-detach system allows shooters to attach or remove the bipod quickly without tools. Its robust construction and enhanced stability make it an essential tool for long-range shooting, competition, and tactical operations, providing a lightweight yet durable solution for precision shooting needs.
