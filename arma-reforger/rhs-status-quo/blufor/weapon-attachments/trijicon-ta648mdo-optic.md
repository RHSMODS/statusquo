# Trijicon TA648MDO Optic

**Overview:**\
The Trijicon TA648MDO is a 6x48mm fixed-magnification Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) designed specifically as a Machine Gun Day Optic (MDO) for the M240 medium machine gun. It provides enhanced target identification and increased hit probability at extended ranges, featuring a dual-illuminated reticle powered by fiber optics and tritium, ensuring visibility in various lighting conditions without the need for batteries.

**Development & Background:**\
The TA648MDO was developed to meet the United States Marine Corps' requirement for a robust and reliable optic to improve the effectiveness of the M240 machine gun. Its 6x magnification allows gunners to engage targets accurately at longer distances, while the 48mm objective lens ensures a bright and clear field of view. The optic includes a bullet drop compensator (BDC) calibrated for the ballistic trajectory of the 7.62mm NATO cartridge, enabling precise aiming without manual adjustments. Additionally, the TA648MDO features a MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail on top, allowing for the attachment of auxiliary sights such as the Trijicon RMR® (Ruggedized Miniature Reflex) for close-quarters engagements.

**Service & Usage:**\
The TA648MDO is officially designated as the SU-260/P in the U.S. Marine Corps and is standard issue for units operating the M240 machine gun. Its rugged construction ensures durability under combat conditions, and the dual-illumination system provides a consistent aiming point in both day and night operations. The integration of the Trijicon RMR® atop the ACOG enhances versatility, allowing gunners to switch seamlessly between magnified and reflexive shooting scenarios.
