# M8541 Scope

**Overview:**\
The M8541 Scout Sniper Day Scope (SSDS) is a high-precision optical sight used by United States Marine Corps (USMC) scout snipers and designated marksmen. Designed for long-range accuracy and target identification, the M8541 features variable magnification, illuminated reticles, and ruggedized construction to withstand harsh combat conditions.

**Development & Background:**\
The M8541 SSDS was introduced as an improved optic for Marine Corps sniper rifles, specifically for use with the M40 series bolt-action sniper rifle. Manufactured to meet military-grade durability and precision standards, the M8541 includes an adjustable magnification system (typically 3-15x or 4-16x), first focal plane (FFP) reticle, and high-quality glass coatings for superior light transmission. The scopeâ€™s elevation and windage turrets provide precise adjustments for long-range engagements, while its shock-resistant construction ensures reliability under combat and environmental stress.

**Service & Usage:**\
The M8541 SSDS is primarily used by USMC scout snipers and designated marksmen, offering superior target acquisition and ballistic compensation for medium- to long-range engagements. It is mounted on M40A5 and M40A6 sniper rifles, providing clear optics in various lighting conditions. The scope is valued for its durability, precision adjustments, and ability to maintain zero in extreme conditions, making it a trusted tool for precision shooters in modern combat environments.
