# AN/PEQ-16A

**Overview:**\
The AN/PEQ-16A is a compact, multifunctional laser aiming and illumination device designed for military and law enforcement applications. It integrates a visible aiming laser, infrared (IR) laser, and a high-intensity white light illuminator, providing enhanced target acquisition capabilities in various lighting conditions. The device is typically mounted on Picatinny rail systems, making it compatible with a wide range of firearms.

**Development & Background:**\
Developed to improve upon earlier laser aiming modules, the AN/PEQ-16A combines multiple functionalities into a single, lightweight unit. This integration reduces the need for separate devices, streamlining equipment and minimizing weight for the operator. The inclusion of both visible and infrared lasers allows for versatility in both covert and overt operations, while the white light illuminator aids in target identification and engagement in low-light scenarios.

**Service & Usage:**\
The AN/PEQ-16A is widely used by military forces and law enforcement agencies, particularly in situations requiring versatility and reliability. Its infrared capabilities are especially valuable for operations involving night vision devices (NVDs), enabling precise targeting without revealing the operator's position. The white light illuminator serves as both a tactical light and a means for target identification, enhancing situational awareness. Its compact design ensures minimal impact on weapon handling, making it a preferred choice for modern tactical operations.
