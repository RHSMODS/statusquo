# M4A1 Carry Handle

**Overview:**\
The M4A1 Carry Handle is a removable iron sight assembly designed for use on M4A1 carbines and other MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail-equipped rifles. It serves as a backup aiming system while also providing a sturdy carry point for weapon transport. The carry handle includes an integrated rear sight, offering adjustable windage and elevation for precise aiming in varied combat environments.

**Development & Background:**\
Originally, fixed carry handles were a standard feature on M16-series rifles, housing the rear sight assembly while providing a means to transport the weapon easily. With the introduction of the M4A1 and other modernized rifle platforms, the removable carry handle was developed to maintain the functionality of traditional iron sights while allowing for the integration of optics, red dot sights, and other aiming devices. The carry handle features a dual-aperture sight, allowing shooters to quickly switch between close-quarters and long-range engagements.

**Service & Usage:**\
The M4A1 Carry Handle is widely used by military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters as a rugged, reliable backup sighting system. It is particularly useful for training, emergency sighting, and weapon configurations that do not require optical attachments. The quick-detach thumb screws allow for easy installation and removal, making it a versatile accessory for users who require a flexible and mission-adaptable rifle setup. Even as optics have become standard issue, the M4A1 carry handle remains a dependable and essential component for iron sight precision shooting.
