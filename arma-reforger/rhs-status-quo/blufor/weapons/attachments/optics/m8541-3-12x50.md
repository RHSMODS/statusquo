The M8541 3-12x50 is a high-end tactical riflescope, renowned for its exceptional clarity and versatility. It features a 3-12x magnification range, making it ideal for both close and long-range engagements. The 50mm objective lens ensures excellent light transmission, resulting in bright and clear images even in low-light conditions. This scope is equipped with a first focal plane reticle, which scales proportionally to the zoom, maintaining the accuracy of range estimation and holdovers across the entire magnification spectrum. The reticle is also illuminated, enhancing visibility against various backgrounds. The M8541 is built with a rugged, shock-resistant body, capable of withstanding the recoil of high-caliber rifles. Its turret adjustments are precise and offer a tactile feel for easy and accurate windage and elevation adjustments. The scope's construction is waterproof and fog-proof, ensuring reliability in diverse weather conditions. Its optical performance and durable build make it a top choice for military, law enforcement, and serious precision shooters.

The reticle scales with the selected zoom so that the reticle markings can be used correctly. The separation between major dots is 1 mil. 1 mil corresponds to 1 m spacing at a distance of 1 km. In the image below you can see a 1 m cube being sighted at 100 m being exactly 10 mils at 3x zoom and below you can see the same at 12x zoom.
