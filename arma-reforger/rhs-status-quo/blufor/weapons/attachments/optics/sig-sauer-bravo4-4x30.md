The horseshoe reticle is sighted for 5,56 round and hits center at 100m. The top of the vertical line is sighted for 50m and 200m. Greater distances can be read off the vertical line. The triangles can be used to estimate distances and measure target sight. The separation between triangles and center line is 10 mils. 1 mil corresponds to 1 m spacing at a distance of 1 km. In the image below you can see a 1 m cube being sighted at 100 m being exactly 10 mils.
