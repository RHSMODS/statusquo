# M38 SDMR

**Overview:**\
The M38 SDMR is a designated marksman rifle utilized by the United States Marine Corps (USMC), designed to enhance the precision engagement capabilities of infantry squads. Essentially an M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle (IAR) configured for the designated marksman role, the M38 provides accurate fire at extended ranges, bridging the gap between standard service rifles and sniper platforms.

**Development & Background:**\
The M38 SDMR was developed to address the need for a squad-level marksman rifle capable of engaging targets beyond the effective range of standard-issue rifles. Building upon the reliable M27 IAR platform, the M38 incorporates enhancements tailored for precision shooting. A key modification is the integration of the Leupold TS-30A2 Mark 4 MR/T 2.5-8Ã—36mm variable power scope, offering greater magnification compared to optics previously used on the M27. The designation "M38" follows the naming convention similar to the M27, honoring the 3rd Battalion, 8th Marines, the unit that tested the rifle.

**Service & Usage:**\
By April 2018, the M38 had been fielded across all three Marine Expeditionary Forces. Each infantry squad is equipped with one M38, fitted with a scope and Quick Detach Sound Suppressor (QDSS), enabling engagement of targets up to 600 meters. The M38 enhances the squad's capability to deliver precise fire at extended ranges, providing a critical asset in various combat scenarios. The rifle retains the selective-fire capabilities of the M27, offering versatility in both semi-automatic and automatic modes.
