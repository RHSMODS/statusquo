# MK153 SMAW Mod 2

## SMAW Mod 2

Mk153 Mod 2 replaces the integrated 9mm spotting rifle that assisted aiming the legacy Mod 0 SMAW, with an electro-optical system known as the Modular Ballistic Sight (MBS)

The Mk 153 Shoulder-Launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon (SMAW) is a smoothbore shoulder-fired rocket launcher. It is a portable assault weapon (i.e., bunker buster) and has a secondary anti-armor ability.

The SMAW's main purpose is to destroy bunkers, buildings, and light armored vehicles, during assault operations, using high-explosive dual mode (HEDM) rockets. The SMAW can also engage armored vehicles using high-explosive anti-armor (HEAA) rockets, which has a maximum effective range of 500 m (550 yards) against a tank-sized target. Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan also saw use of a thermobaric rocket, called the SMAW-NE (Novel Explosive), which can be used to collapse buildings or cave openings.

## Modular Ballistic Sight

The MBS system consists of the AN/PSQ-23A laser rangefinder and the AN/PAS-13G Light Weapon Thermal Sight (LWTS). To engage a target, the gunner first acquires the target using the thermal sight (AN/PAS-13G), which allows them to see the target in various environmental conditions. Once the target is acquired, the gunner depresses a button on the front grip to activate the laser rangefinder (AN/PSQ-23A). The rangefinder emits a laser pulse to measure the range to the target. This range data is then sent to the thermal sight, which processes the information and adjusts the reticle, displaying a chevron symbol that indicates the correct point of aim based on the range, external temperature, and selected rocket type. The gunner then aligns the chevron with the target and fires. The Mod 2 also has a reduced weight of 13 lb (5.9 kg) with the MBS attached, along with other improvements, like increased pad size on the forward grip and foldable backup iron sights. The Mk 153 Mod 2 reached full operational capability (FOC) across the United States Marine Corps between 2019 and 2020.
