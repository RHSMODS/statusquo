# 40mm M715 Marker Grenade (Yellow Smoke)

**Overview:**\
The M715 Marker Grenade is a 40mm low-velocity smoke grenade designed for use with under-barrel grenade launchers (UBGLs) such as the M203, M320, and similar platforms. It is used for target marking, signalling, and obscuration in both combat and training scenarios. The M715 produces yellow smoke, making it effective for battlefield communication and coordination.

**Development & Background:**\
The M715 smoke grenade is part of a series of 40mm coloured smoke marker rounds, developed to enhance unit coordination, target designation, and signalling for fire support. Upon impact, the grenade releases a dense yellow smoke cloud, which remains visible for 30 to 40 seconds, depending on environmental conditions. Like other smoke marker grenades, the M715 is non-lethal, intended solely for marking and signalling purposes.

**Service & Usage:**\
The M715 Yellow Smoke Grenade is primarily used in battlefield target marking, landing zone designation, and fire support coordination. The high-visibility yellow smoke makes it particularly useful for indicating friendly positions, directing air support, and guiding troop movements. In urban and open-field engagements, it can also be used for obscuration or signaling during maneuvers. The M715 is part of a color-coded marking system, with other variants like the M713 (Red) and M714 (Green) smoke grenades serving similar functions.
