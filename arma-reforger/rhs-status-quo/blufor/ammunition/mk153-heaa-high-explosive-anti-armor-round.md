# Mk153 HEAA (High-Explosive Anti-Armor) Round

**Overview:**\
The Mk153 HEAA (High-Explosive Anti-Armor) round is a specialized anti-tank warhead designed for use with the Mk153 Shoulder-Launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon (SMAW). Engineered for maximum armour penetration, the HEAA round is highly effective against armoured vehicles, bunkers, and reinforced enemy positions.

**Development & Background:**\
The Mk153 SMAW is a shoulder-fired, reusable rocket launcher primarily used by the United States Marine Corps (USMC). While the HEDP (High-Explosive Dual-Purpose) round is more versatile, the HEAA variant was specifically developed to engage and destroy armored threats. Featuring a shaped charge warhead, the HEAA round can penetrate up to 600mm of rolled homogeneous armor (RHA), making it highly effective against main battle tanks (MBTs), armored personnel carriers (APCs), and reinforced structures..

**Service & Usage:**\
The Mk153 HEAA round is used in anti-armor engagements, ambush operations, and defensive positions where highly armored targets must be neutralized. Its high penetration capability allows infantry units to counter enemy armor without requiring dedicated anti-tank missile systems. The HEAA round is particularly useful in urban warfare, open battlefield scenarios, and mechanized infantry operations, providing a lightweight yet powerful solution for engaging armoured threats.
