# Mk153 NE (Novel Explosive) Round

**Overview:**\
The Mk153 NE (Novel Explosive) round is a specialized high-explosive warhead designed for use with the Mk153 Shoulder-Launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon (SMAW). This round is developed for anti-structure and bunker-busting operations, offering enhanced blast effects against fortified positions, enemy personnel in cover, and light vehicles.

**Development & Background:**\
The Mk153 SMAW is a reusable, shoulder-fired rocket launcher used primarily by the United States Marine Corps (USMC) for urban warfare and anti-fortification roles. The NE (Novel Explosive) warhead was developed to provide greater blast overpressure effects, making it highly effective against enclosed enemy positions such as bunkers, buildings, and caves. Unlike traditional high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rounds designed for armour penetration, the Mk153 NE focuses on maximizing concussive force, making it more suitable for infantry support and demolition roles.

**Service & Usage:**\
The Mk153 NE round is employed in urban combat, counter-insurgency operations, and fortification clearing missions where maximum blast effect is required to neutralize enemy forces in enclosed spaces. The warhead is particularly effective in destroying enemy strongpoints, collapsing defensive positions, and eliminating threats behind cover. It is a preferred choice for breaching operations and combat engineers, providing superior firepower against hardened targets.
