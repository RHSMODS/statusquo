# 7.62x51mm M40 M80 5-Round Magazine

**Overview:**\
The 7.62x51mm M40 M80 5-round magazine is a standard-issue detachable box magazine used in M40 sniper rifle variants, loaded with M80 Ball ammunition. This configuration provides consistent performance for general-purpose engagements, offering reliable accuracy and penetration in medium- to long-range combat scenarios.

**Development & Background:**\
The M40 sniper rifle series, originally developed for the United States Marine Corps (USMC), is a bolt-action precision rifle based on the Remington 700 platform. The M80 Ball round, a full metal jacket (FMJ) projectile, has been the standard 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge since the 1950s, offering balanced performance with reliable feeding and effective range. Unlike specialized armour-piercing (M61) or tracer (M62) rounds, M80 Ball ammunition is designed for general-purpose use, making it an ideal choice for training, designated marksmen roles, and standard sniper operations.

**Service & Usage:**\
The M40 M80 5-round magazine is widely used by Marine Corps scout snipers, designated marksmen, and law enforcement sharpshooters, where a dependable and accurate round is required for consistent shot placement. While not optimized for armour penetration or fire tracking, the M80 Ball round delivers reliable ballistics for engagements against enemy personnel and unarmoured targets. The 5-round magazine capacity allows for precise shot placement with minimal weight, ensuring stability and manoeuvrability in sniper operations.
