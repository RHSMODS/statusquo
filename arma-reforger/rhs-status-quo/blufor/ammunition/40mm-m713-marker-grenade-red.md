# 40mm M713 Marker Grenade (Red)

**Overview:**\
The M713 Marker Grenade is a 40mm low-velocity smoke grenade designed for use with under-barrel grenade launchers (UBGLs) such as the M203, M320, and similar platforms. It is used for target marking, signalling, and obscuring enemy vision in various combat and training scenarios. The M713 produces red smoke, making it ideal for air-ground coordination and battlefield communication.

**Development & Background:**\
The M713 smoke grenade is part of a series of 40mm coloured smoke marker rounds, developed to provide visual signals for unit coordination and fire support. It features a pyrotechnic smoke composition, which is expelled upon impact, creating a dense red smoke cloud that remains visible for 30 to 40 seconds, depending on environmental conditions. Unlike high-explosive grenades, the M713 is non-lethal, designed purely for marking and obscuration.

**Service & Usage:**\
The M713 Red Smoke Grenade is primarily used for battlefield marking, target designation, and signaling in military operations. It is commonly deployed to indicate landing zones, direct artillery or airstrikes, and provide visual cues for ground forces. In urban and jungle warfare, it can also be used to obscure enemy vision or signal friendly units during movement. The M713 is part of a color-coded marking system, with other variants like the M714 (Green) and M715 (Yellow) smoke grenades serving similar functions.
