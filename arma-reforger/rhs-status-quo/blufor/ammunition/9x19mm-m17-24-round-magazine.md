# 9x19mm M17 24-Round Magazine

**Overview:**\
The 9x19mm M17 24-round magazine is a high-capacity detachable box magazine designed for use with the M17 and M18 service pistols. Providing an increased ammunition capacity over standard 17-round magazines, the 24-round variant enhances sustained fire capability, making it ideal for military, law enforcement, and tactical applications.\


**Development & Background:**\
The M17 and M18 Modular Handgun System (MHS) were adopted by the U.S. military to replace the Beretta M9, with an emphasis on modularity and increased firepower. To support extended engagements and special operations, a 24-round extended magazine was developed, offering additional rounds while maintaining reliable feeding and durability under combat conditions. The magazine features a steel body, anti-friction coating, and a polymer baseplate, ensuring resistance to harsh environments and rapid reload efficiency

**Service & Usage:**\
The M17 24-round magazine is primarily issued to military personnel, security forces, and special operations units, where increased ammunition capacity is beneficial for close-quarters combat, defensive operations, and sustained firefights. It allows operators to engage multiple targets without frequent reloads, making it a valuable asset in high-intensity engagements. Compatible with both the full-sized M17 and compact M18, this magazine enhances the versatility and combat effectiveness of the U.S. military's standard-issue sidearms.
