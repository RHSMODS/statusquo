# 40mm M716 Marker Grenade (Violet Smoke)

**Overview:**\
The M716 Marker Grenade is a 40mm low-velocity smoke grenade designed for use with under-barrel grenade launchers (UBGLs) such as the M203, M320, and similar platforms. It produces violet smoke, primarily used for target marking, signalling, and obscuration in combat and training environments.

**Development & Background:**\
The M716 smoke grenade is part of a series of 40mm coloured smoke marker rounds, developed to provide enhanced battlefield communication and unit coordination. Upon impact, the grenade releases a dense violet smoke cloud, which remains visible for 30 to 40 seconds, depending on wind and weather conditions. Like other smoke marker grenades, the M716 is non-lethal, intended solely for marking and signalling.

**Service & Usage:**\
The M716 Violet Smoke Grenade is used for battlefield signalling, target marking, and landing zone designation. The distinct violet smoke is particularly useful for differentiating signals from more common red, yellow, or green smoke grenades, reducing the chance of confusion during operations. It can also be deployed for obscuring troop movements, signalling friendly positions, and guiding aircraft or ground units. The M716 is part of a color-coded marking system, with other variants like the M713 (Red), M714 (Green), and M715 (Yellow) smoke grenades serving similar functions.
