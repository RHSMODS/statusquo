# 5.56x45mm STANAG 30-Round M995 Magazine

**Overview:**\
The 5.56x45mm STANAG 30-round M995 magazine is a high-performance armor-piercing (AP) ammunition configuration designed for use in NATO-compatible rifles, such as the M4A1, M16, and other STANAG-compliant platforms. Loaded with M995 armour-piercing rounds, this magazine is intended for engagements against hardened targets, including body armour, light vehicles, and fortified positions.

**Development & Background:**\
The M995 armor-piercing round was developed to provide enhanced penetration capabilities over standard ball ammunition, addressing threats posed by modern ballistic armour and lightly armored vehicles. The M995 features a tungsten carbide core, significantly increasing its ability to defeat hardened steel and advanced body armor. Standard STANAG 30-round magazines used for M995 rounds incorporate reinforced feed lips and internal coatings to accommodate the higher chamber pressures and increased wear associated with firing armor-piercing ammunition.

**Service & Usage:**\
The M995-loaded 30-round STANAG magazine is primarily issued to special operations forces, designated marksmen, and infantry units facing armored threats. It is used in urban combat, counter-terrorism operations, and engagements where enemy forces are equipped with body armour or utilizing cover that standard M855A1 rounds struggle to penetrate. Due to its specialized role, M995 ammunition is typically issued in limited quantities, with operators using it strategically for armor-defeating purposes rather than general combat engagements.
