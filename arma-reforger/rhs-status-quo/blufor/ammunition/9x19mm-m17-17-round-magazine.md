# 9x19mm M17 17-Round Magazine

**Overview:**\
The 9x19mm M17 17-round magazine is the standard-issue detachable box magazine for the M17 and M18 Modular Handgun System (MHS). Designed to provide a balance of capacity, reliability, and compactness, the 17-round magazine ensures optimal performance for military, law enforcement, and tactical users.

**Development & Background:**\
As part of the M17/M18 pistol system, the 17-round magazine was developed to replace the 15-round magazine of the Beretta M9, offering an increase in capacity while maintaining a compact profile for duty use. Constructed from durable steel with an anti-friction coating, the magazine is designed for smooth feeding, corrosion resistance, and extended service life. The polymer baseplate enhances durability while allowing for quick reloads in high-stress environments.

**Service & Usage:**\
The M17 17-round magazine is the primary magazine issued with the M17 and M18 handguns, widely used by military forces, law enforcement agencies, and security personnel. Its compact size makes it suitable for holstered carry and general-purpose sidearm use, while still providing ample capacity for combat scenarios. The magazine is interchangeable between the M17 and M18, ensuring logistical efficiency and compatibility across different roles.
