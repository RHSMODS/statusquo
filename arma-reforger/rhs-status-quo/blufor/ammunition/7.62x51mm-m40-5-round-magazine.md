# 7.62x51mm M40 5-Round Magazine

**Overview:**\
The 7.62x51mm M40 5-round magazine is a low-capacity, precision-designed detachable box magazine used in M40 sniper rifle variants. It is optimized for feeding precision ammunition reliably, ensuring consistent performance in long-range engagements where accuracy and stability are critical.

**Development & Background:**\
The M40 sniper rifle series, originally adopted by the United States Marine Corps (USMC), was designed as a bolt-action precision rifle based on the Remington 700 platform. The 5-round magazine capacity was chosen to prioritize feeding reliability, reduced weight, and improved handling for precision shooting applications. The magazine is built from high-strength steel or aluminum, featuring anti-corrosion coatings and reinforced feed lips to ensure durability and consistent round cycling under field conditions.

**Service & Usage:**\
The M40 5-round magazine is used primarily by Marine Corps scout snipers and designated marksmen, where precision and shot placement are more important than high-volume fire. The low capacity minimizes bulk, allowing for a sleeker rifle profile and easier prone positioning. While modern semi-automatic sniper platforms have increased capacity, the M40 and its 5-round magazine continue to see use in designated marksman and sniper roles, offering exceptional accuracy and reliability in long-range engagements.
