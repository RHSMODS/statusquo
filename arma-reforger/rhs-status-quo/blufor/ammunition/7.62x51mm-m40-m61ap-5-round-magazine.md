# 7.62x51mm M40 M61AP 5-Round Magazine

**Overview:**\
The 7.62x51mm M40 M61AP 5-round magazine is a precision-designed detachable box magazine used in M40 sniper rifle variants, specifically loaded with M61 Armor-Piercing (AP) ammunition. This configuration provides enhanced penetration capabilities, allowing snipers and designated marksmen to engage lightly armoured targets, hardened structures, and enemy personnel in cover while maintaining long-range accuracy.

**Development & Background:**\
The M40 sniper rifle series, based on the Remington 700 bolt-action platform, has been a standard precision rifle for the United States Marine Corps (USMC). While the standard 5-round magazine is designed for general-purpose sniper ammunition, loading it with M61 AP rounds significantly increases its capability against armored threats. The M61 AP round features a tungsten core, designed to penetrate hardened targets, including light vehicles, body armor, and fortified positions. The magazine itself is constructed from reinforced steel or aluminium, ensuring reliability, corrosion resistance, and consistent feeding under combat conditions.

**Service & Usage:**\
The M40 M61AP 5-round magazine is primarily issued to Marine Corps scout snipers and designated marksmen operating in environments where armour-piercing capabilities are necessary. It is particularly effective in urban warfare, counter-sniper operations, and engagements where standard ball ammunition is insufficient against enemy cover or armour. The low capacity allows for better handling and stability, making it ideal for precision shooting scenarios where accuracy is prioritized over volume of fire.
