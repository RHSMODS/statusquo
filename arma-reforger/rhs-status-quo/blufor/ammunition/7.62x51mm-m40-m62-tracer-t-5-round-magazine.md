# 7.62x51mm M40 M62 Tracer (T) 5-Round Magazine

**Overview:**\
The 7.62x51mm M40 M62 Tracer (T) 5-round magazine is a precision-designed detachable box magazine for M40 sniper rifle variants, specifically loaded with M62 Tracer ammunition. This configuration is used for target marking, fire adjustment, and increased visibility in low-light engagements, assisting designated marksmen and snipers in tracking bullet trajectories.

**Development & Background:**\
The M40 sniper rifle series, originally adopted by the United States Marine Corps (USMC), is designed for precision shooting at long distances. The M62 Tracer round is a 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge with an orange-tipped bullet containing a pyrotechnic composition, which ignites upon firing, making the round visible to the shooter and spotters. Tracer rounds allow snipers to adjust fire more effectively, particularly during night operations or engagements at extended ranges. The 5-round magazine ensures smooth feeding, minimal weight, and maximum stability for precision marksmanship

**Service & Usage:**\
The M40 M62 Tracer 5-round magazine is primarily used by Marine Corps scout snipers and designated marksmen for spotting, directing fire, and training purposes. The high-visibility nature of tracer rounds allows snipers to observe shot placement in real-time, making them effective in coordinated engagements, night operations, and suppressive fire scenarios. While tracers are typically used every few rounds in mixed-load magazines, this dedicated tracer magazine is valuable for marking enemy positions and signalling allied forces in low-visibility conditions.
