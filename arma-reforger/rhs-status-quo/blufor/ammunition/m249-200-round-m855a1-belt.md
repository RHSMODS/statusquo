# M249 200-Round M855A1 Belt

**Overview:**\
The M249 200-round M855A1 belt is a linked ammunition belt designed for use with the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW), providing sustained automatic fire for infantry support roles. Loaded with M855A1 Enhanced Performance Rounds (EPR), this belt offers improved penetration, accuracy, and terminal ballistics over the older M855 rounds, making it a more effective solution against armoured targets and enemy personnel behind cover.

**Development & Background:**\
The M249 SAW, introduced in the 1980s, serves as a light machine gun for fire suppression and squad support, using a belt-fed or magazine-fed system. The M855A1 EPR was developed to enhance the lethality of 5.56x45mm ammunition, featuring a steel penetrator and a copper slug, increasing effectiveness against hardened surfaces and body armor. The transition to M855A1 required reinforced feed tray designs on some M249 models due to increased chamber pressures and wear from the hardened bullet.

**Service & Usage:**\
The M249 200-round M855A1 belt is standard issue for light machine gunners in infantry squads, providing sustained suppressive fire in urban, open-field, and defensive engagements. The enhanced performance of the M855A1 round ensures that machine gunners can effectively engage enemy forces at greater distances, penetrate cover, and counter light armour threats. The 200-round belt, stored in a soft or hard ammunition pouch, allows for prolonged firing without frequent reloads, making it a crucial asset in fire support and suppression roles.
