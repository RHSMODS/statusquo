# FROG Combat Shirt

**Overview:**\
The FROG Combat Shirt is a flame-resistant tactical shirt designed for use by United States Marine Corps (USMC) personnel as part of the Flame Resistant Organizational Gear (FROG) system. It provides flame protection, moisture-wicking properties, and lightweight comfort when worn under body armor or plate carriers. Engineered to reduce heat stress while maintaining protection against flash and flame exposure, the FROG Combat Shirt is a key component in modern combat uniforms for high-risk environments.

**Development & Background:**\
The FROG system was developed in response to the increasing threat of burn injuries from IEDs and fuel fires faced by Marines in combat zones. The FROG Combat Shirt combines no-melt, no-drip, flame-resistant materials with the functional design of a combat shirt, offering improved protection without sacrificing comfort. The torso is made from lightweight, flame-resistant knit fabric to increase breathability under body armor, while the sleeves are constructed from a heavier flame-resistant ripstop material to enhance durability and abrasion resistance. Additional features include zippered sleeve pockets, elbow pad compatibility, and loop panels for rank and unit patches, tailored to the operational needs of Marines in various combat environments.

**Service & Usage:**\
The FROG Combat Shirt is standard issue for USMC personnel deployed in combat and high-risk operational theaters, providing protection against flash fire hazards and heat stress. It is worn underneath plate carriers and tactical vests, minimizing chafing and thermal buildup during extended missions. The shirt is commonly used in urban warfare, desert operations, and amphibious assaults, supporting the Marine Corps' emphasis on expeditionary readiness and adaptability. Its proven durability, protection, and comfort make it a critical garment for Marines operating in hazardous and demanding environments.
