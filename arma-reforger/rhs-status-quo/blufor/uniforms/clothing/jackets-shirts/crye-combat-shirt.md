# Crye Combat Shirt

**Overview:**\
The Crye Precision Combat Shirt is a lightweight, flame-resistant combat top designed for use under body armor in high-intensity tactical operations. Engineered for comfort, breathability, and mobility, it features moisture-wicking, no-melt/no-drip torso fabric with durable, abrasion-resistant sleeves. The design prioritizes ventilation and operational functionality, making it a preferred choice for military special operations, law enforcement, and tactical units.

**Development & Background:**\
Developed by Crye Precision as part of their Combat Apparel line, the combat shirt was designed in direct response to feedback from elite military units requiring a low-profile, high-performance uniform component compatible with modern plate carriers. The torso is constructed from a lightweight, stretch fabric to reduce heat retention under armor, while the sleeves and shoulders are made from tough NYCO ripstop material for enhanced protection and durability. Integrated elbow pad pockets, zippered bicep pockets, and loop panels for patches and IFF markings reflect the company’s emphasis on field-ready modularity and function.

**Service & Usage:**\
The Crye Combat Shirt is widely adopted by U.S. and allied special operations forces, as well as tactical law enforcement teams. Worn beneath plate carriers and body armor, the shirt enhances comfort during extended operations, minimizes heat buildup, and protects the user’s arms from environmental hazards. Its anatomical fit, reduced bulk, and combat-proven materials make it ideal for urban, jungle, desert, and mountain warfare environments. The combat shirt remains a staple in modern tactical apparel systems, offering a balance of protection, performance, and wearability in demanding conditions.
