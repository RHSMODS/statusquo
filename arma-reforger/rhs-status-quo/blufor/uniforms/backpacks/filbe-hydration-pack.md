# FILBE Hydration Pack

**Overview:**\
The Family of Improved Load Bearing Equipment (FILBE) is the United States Marine Corps' standard for individual load-carrying equipment, designed to enhance durability and compatibility with modern body armor systems. A key component of this system is the FILBE Hydration Pack, which ensures Marines have access to water during operations. The hydration pack typically includes a hydration pouch and a hydration bladder system.

**Development & Background:**\
The FILBE system was developed to address limitations in previous load-bearing equipment, such as the Improved Load Bearing Equipment (ILBE), which was not fully compatible with newer body armor designs. The FILBE Hydration Pack integrates seamlessly with the FILBE system, offering modularity and improved ergonomics. The hydration pouch is constructed from durable nylon Cordura and is MOLLE compatible, allowing it to attach securely to vests or packs. It features a flap top with an adjustable quick-release buckle and interior loops to hold the hydration tube in place. The pouch is designed to hold up to a 3-liter bladder (not included) and measures 9.5 inches in width by 15 inches in height.
