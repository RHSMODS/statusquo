# ACH

The Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) is a significant upgrade in military protective gear, primarily constructed from Kevlar, known for its high strength-to-weight ratio. This material choice offers superior ballistic protection against small arms fire and shrapnel. The ACH's design optimizes the balance between comprehensive coverage and weight management, improving upon its predecessors like the PASGT helmet in both protection and comfort. Its enhanced ballistic capabilities are crucial in modern combat, providing robust protection against direct bullet and fragment impacts.

In addition to its protective qualities, the ACH is designed for comfort and compatibility with other military equipment. It features adjustable internal padding, ensuring a comfortable and secure fit for various head sizes, and is adaptable with communication systems, night vision devices, and goggles. The helmet also supports modular attachments, like visors and camouflage covers, allowing for customization according to different mission requirements. Despite its enhanced protection, the ACH maintains a lighter weight, aiding in mobility and reducing fatigue during prolonged use, making it a standard issue in many military units worldwide.
