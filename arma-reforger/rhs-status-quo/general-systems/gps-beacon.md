# GPS Radio Beacon

**Overview:**\
The GPS Radio Beacon is a compact, waterproof professional tracking device designed for emergency location marking and vehicle tracking. Featuring a real-time GPS and LBS (Location-Based Service) tracking system, it provides accurate position data and distress signals within a 4 km transmission range. Operating on a 101-225 kHz frequency band, the beacon supports multiple alarm functions, remote monitoring, and real-time alerts, making it an essential tool for military, law enforcement, and search-and-rescue (SAR) operations.

**Development & Background:**\
The GPS Radio Beacon was developed to enhance situational awareness and emergency response capabilities in combat zones, covert operations, and search-and-rescue missions. Inspired by maritime distress beacons, it incorporates modern tracking solutions, allowing users to transmit location data via GSM, SMS, or Internet-based networks. Its rechargeable 3.7V 500mAh Li-ion battery ensures rapid deployment, while multiple power-saving modes reduce energy consumption during extended standby operations. The beacon can also store up to 16,000 location points, enabling post-mission tracking and analysis.

**Service & Usage:**\
The GPS Radio Beacon is widely used in military reconnaissance, law enforcement surveillance, and emergency response scenarios. Operators can remotely monitor movements, activate alarms for unauthorized access, and track assets or personnel using web, PC, or mobile applications. Equipped with an extra-long external microphone, the device supports audio monitoring for tactical operations. The multiple alarm system, including low battery alerts, movement alarms, and GPS blind spot notifications, enhances security and tracking accuracy. Though its battery lasts for 15 minutes upon activation, its automated distress signal transmission ensures rapid response and retrieval in critical situations.
