It is forbidden to distribute the content of this package by itself, or as part of another distribution, using the Arma Reforger Workshop by anyone other than Red Hammer Studios (RHS).

You may NOT use the material for commercial purposes. This includes running this package on server instances that employ any monetization schemes, including, but not limited to, donate-reward systems. Approval of your monetization scheme by Bohemia Interactive (whether server-side or addon) does not exempt you from this EULA clause.

The only method of distribution allowed is the official[ Bohemia Interactive Arma Platform Workshop](https://reforger.armaplatform.com/workshop). Any and all other methods of distribution are prohibited.

This add-on is provided exclusively for Arma Reforger and is not to be used for the purpose of military training.

There will be no individual permissions outside of our EULA.

Please note that the above-mentioned agreement gives Red Hammer Studios the right to waive any of the conditions at our discretion.

### Derivative content&#x20;

Derivative content refers to any and all modifications based on RHS content. It includes any dependency mods that make use of, or make changes to, our existing files, including re-textures.

&#x20;In general, we choose to tolerate derivative mods based on our original content, as long as these mods do not negatively impact the image of RHS, promote terrorism, extremism, pornography, nudity, or any other immoral acts or behaviors.

However, under the RHS Non-Derivatives End User Agreement, we reserve the right to enforce our non-derivatives clause to protect our intellectual property, without prior notice or explanations, at our discretion, in accordance with but not limited to, the present EULA and/or individual RHS members/author's requests.

For any derivative content to be **tolerated**, a set of rules needs to be followed strictly:

* Any commercial modding avenues based on RHS content are strictly prohibited.
* All derivative/dependency mods based on RHS must be published publicly (unlisted derivative/dependency mods are NOT allowed).
* All derivative content must be published under a similar non-derivative license (BI's _APL-ND, for instance_).
* All derivative content must have a link in its description to this [EULA page](https://docs.rhsmods.org/rhs-status-quo-user-documentation/arma-reforger/rhs-status-quo/eula)

Any breach of the above rules will automatically lead to enforcement of our non-derivative clause in our license and removal of the derivative mod from Bohemia's Interactive Workbench.

### No depiction of ongoing wars

We, the development team of RHS, unanimously do NOT condone any real-life wars, past, present, or future.

Any depiction of the ongoing invasion of Russian forces in Ukraine using any derivative content based of RHS assets is strictly PROHIBITED.

This includes but is not limited to, any use of Russian war markings (Z, O, V, etc) and/or Ukrainian war markings on any existing or future RHS assets.

&#x20;Any depiction of the ongoing conflict between Israeli forces and Palestine using any derivative content based of RHS assets is strictly PROHIBITED.

&#x20;There will be no exceptions.

&#x20;Per our non-derivative license, we will take all the required legal steps to protect our image, our content, and our users from such depictions, including takedowns, C\&D, and asking for infringements/requesting Workshop/Workbench removal from the Game's developers, Bohemia Interactive.

### No Monetization

We have a strict NO monetization policy for our Status Quo mod for Arma Reforger

We consider any sale--money paid in exchange for any direct in-game return--to be a breach of the above non-commercial clause of the EULA.

&#x20;Here are a few of the most common offenses (this is by no means an exhaustive list):

* charging players specific amounts to access to or have priority while connecting to a server
* charging players for specific in-game perks (cosmetic or otherwise)
* selling in-game items, in-game currency or any sort of game-mode experience points
* product placement or endorsements
* setting a term donation goal that will lead to in-game benefits (perks, items and/or in-game currency)

### Limitations

Due to repeated infringements of the existing Red Hammer Studios EULA and/or Bohemia's Interactive Terms of Service and/or other reasons, the following groups/persons are STRICTLY PROHIBITED from using RHS mods and creating any derivative content based on RHS Status Quo or any other past, present, or future RHS mods:
