A functional copy of the Elcan SpectreDR, the 1P86 is a 1x-4x optical sight for the 5,45 round. Unlike many Russian sights it uses the picatinny rail system by default.

Use **`Alt+MWheel`** to switch between the 1x and 4x zoom. The reticle is to be used only with the 4x setting. The vertical lines can be used to estimate distances and measure target sight. The separation between major lines is 10 mils. 1 mil corresponds to 1 m spacing at a distance of 1 km. In the image below you can see a 1 m cube being sighted at 100 m being exactly 10 mils.
