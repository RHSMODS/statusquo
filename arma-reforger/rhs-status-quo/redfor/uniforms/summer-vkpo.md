Moreover, it features enhanced durability thanks to the inclusion of reinforced rip-stop threads. Special inserts in the seats, knees, and elbows accommodate protective pads. Treated with the durable mosquito repellent permethrin, the VKPO summer kit remains resistant even after multiple washes, eliminating the need for additional repellents.
