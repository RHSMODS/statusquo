The 1PN138 is a multi-purpose night vision monocular developed by the NPO Valday. This device is used by the RU military and special forces for a range of applications, including tactical operations, surveillance, and navigation.

The 1PN138 uses light amplification technology to enable the user to see in low-light or nighttime conditions. It works by gathering ambient light, such as moonlight or starlight, and amplifying it to create a visible picture. This device can also work with an infrared (IR) illuminator in total darkness, where no ambient light is available.
