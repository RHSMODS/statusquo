# What is INDFOR?

**INDFOR** (Independent Forces) is a term commonly used in military simulations, wargames, and video games, particularly in the **Arma series**, to designate a faction that is neither explicitly friendly (BLUFOR, or "Blue Forces") nor explicitly hostile (OPFOR, or "Opposing Forces"). Instead, INDFOR factions operate independently and may engage in combat with both BLUFOR and OPFOR, depending on mission objectives, allegiances, or situational factors

In the context of RHS: Status Quo, Independent Forces have been chosen to represent the PMC faction ION.
