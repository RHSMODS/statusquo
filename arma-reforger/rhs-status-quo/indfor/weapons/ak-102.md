# AK-102

**Overview:**\
The AK-102 is a compact carbine variant of the AK-101, chambered in 5.56x45mm, designed for enhanced maneuverability while maintaining the reliability of the AK platform. As part of the AK-100 series, it retains the core features of its predecessors but with a shorter barrel and a lightweight polymer construction, making it ideal for close-quarters combat (CQC) and airborne operations.

**Development & Background:**\
The AK-102 was developed alongside the AK-101 as part of a modernization effort to offer export-friendly AK rifles compatible with NATO-standard 5.56x45mm ammunition. While the AK-101 features a full-length barrel, the AK-102 was specifically designed as a short-barreled carbine, similar in role to the AKS-74U but with improved handling and modularity. The polymer stock, handguard, and pistol grip reduce weight, while the side-folding stock enhances portability for mechanized and airborne forces.

**Service & Usage:**\
The AK-102 is well-suited for special forces, vehicle crews, and law enforcement units, where a compact yet effective rifle is required. Its shorter barrel improves handling in urban warfare and confined spaces, while the side-mounted optics rail allows for customization with modern optics and accessories. The rifle retains the gas-operated, long-stroke piston system, ensuring reliability in harsh environments. Its ability to use NATO-standard ammunition makes it a viable choice for international security forces and private military companies operating with Western logistical support.\
