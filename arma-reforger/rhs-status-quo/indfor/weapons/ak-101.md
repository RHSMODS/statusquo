# AK-101

**Overview:**\
The AK-101 is a modernized assault rifle chambered in 5.56x45mm, designed as part of the AK-100 series to offer compatibility with NATO-standard ammunition while retaining the legendary durability and reliability of the AK platform. Featuring polymer furniture, a side-folding stock, and a rail mount for optics, the AK-101 provides a balance between firepower, adaptability, and ease of use.

**Development & Background:**\
The AK-101 was developed as part of the AK-100 series, a line of rifles based on the AK-74M but designed for export and foreign military markets. Unlike traditional AK rifles chambered in 7.62x39mm or 5.45x39mm, the AK-101 was specifically built to fire the NATO-standard 5.56x45mm cartridge, making it an attractive option for militaries and security forces operating with Western ammunition supplies. It retains the gas-operated, long-stroke piston system of previous AK models, ensuring reliability in extreme conditions, while incorporating modernized materials such as high-impact polymer stocks and handguards to reduce weight and improve durability.

**Service & Usage:**\
The AK-101 is primarily used by military and paramilitary forces in regions where 5.56x45mm ammunition is standard. Its side-folding stock and rugged construction make it a practical choice for airborne, mechanized, and special operations units operating in urban and rural environments. The rifle's Picatinny side rail allows for the mounting of modern optics and accessories, enhancing its versatility in tactical engagements. Due to its compatibility with NATO ammunition, the AK-101 serves as a reliable alternative to Western assault rifles, offering a familiar AK design with enhanced adaptability.\
