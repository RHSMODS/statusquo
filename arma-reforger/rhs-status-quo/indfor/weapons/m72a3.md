# M72A3

**Overview:**\
The M72A3 LAW (Light Anti-Tank Weapon) is a portable, single-shot, disposable rocket launcher, chambered for 66mm high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rockets. Designed for infantry use, the M72A3 provides a lightweight and effective means of neutralizing armored vehicles, fortifications, and enemy positions with a fire-and-forget system that requires minimal training.

**Development & Background:**\
The M72 LAW was originally developed in the 1960s as a replacement for the M31 HEAT rifle grenade and the M20 “Super Bazooka”. The system was designed to be lightweight, easy to carry, and simple to use, allowing individual soldiers to engage light armor and fortified positions without requiring a crew-served weapon. The M72A3 variant introduced improvements in warhead penetration and reliability, making it more effective against armored targets and hardened structures.

**Service & Usage:**\
The M72A3 LAW has been widely used by infantry forces in conflicts worldwide, including the Vietnam War, Gulf War, and modern counterinsurgency operations. The compact design allows soldiers to carry multiple units, and its disposable nature eliminates the need for reloading in combat. The launcher is particularly effective for ambush tactics, urban warfare, and anti-armour engagements, providing troops with a cost-effective and portable anti-tank capability.\
