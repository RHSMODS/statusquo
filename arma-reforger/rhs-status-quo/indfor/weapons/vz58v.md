# VZ58V

**Overview:**\
The Vz. 58V is a folding-stock variant of the Vz. 58 assault rifle, chambered in 7.62x39mm. Designed for airborne and mechanized infantry, the Vz. 58V retains the same lightweight, short-stroke gas piston system and milled receiver as the standard Vz. 58P but features a side-folding metal stock for improved portability and compactness in confined spaces.

**Development & Background:**\
The Vz. 58 (Vzor 58) was developed in Czechoslovakia in the late 1950s as a domestic alternative to the AK-47. While it shares the same caliber, the Vz. 58 is a unique design, utilizing a tilting bolt mechanism, a short-stroke gas piston system, and a lighter overall weight compared to the AK platform. The Vz. 58V was introduced alongside the standard Vz. 58P to provide airborne troops, vehicle crews, and special units with a more compact rifle that could be easily carried and deployed in tight spaces.

**Service & Usage:**\
The Vz. 58V was widely issued to Czechoslovak airborne and mechanized forces, offering improved maneuverability without compromising firepower. Its folding stock allows for easier transport and storage, making it particularly useful for paratroopers, armored vehicle crews, and special operations personnel. While it has been gradually replaced by modern firearms, the Vz. 58V remains in service with reserve units, security forces, and civilian collectors, valued for its robust construction, reliability, and unique handling characteristics.\
