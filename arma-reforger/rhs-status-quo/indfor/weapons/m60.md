# M60

**Overview**\
The M60 is a belt-fed, air-cooled, gas-operated machine gun chambered in 7.62x51mm NATO, designed to provide sustained suppressive fire for infantry squads, vehicles, and support units. Known for its distinctive design and versatility, the M60 has been a staple of U.S. military firepower since its introduction, serving as both a general-purpose machine gun (GPMG) and a mounted weapon for armoured and aerial platforms.

**Development & Background:**\
The M60 was developed in the late 1940s and early 1950s, inspired by German machine gun designs from World War II, particularly the MG42 and FG42. It was officially adopted by the U.S. military in 1957, replacing older .30 caliber machine guns such as the M1919 Browning. Featuring a quick-change barrel system, bipod support, and a built-in carrying handle, the M60 was designed to be lighter and more maneuverable than previous medium machine guns. Despite early reliability concerns, continuous improvements led to enhanced variants that extended its service life.

**Service & Usage:**\
The M60 saw extensive combat use during the Vietnam War, where it earned the nickname “The Pig” due to its bulk and high rate of fire. It was deployed as a squad automatic weapon, a vehicle-mounted machine gun, and a helicopter door gun. The M60 remained a standard U.S. military weapon throughout the Cold War, Gulf War, and other conflicts before being largely replaced by the M240 series in frontline service. However, improved versions, such as the M60E4/Mk 43, continue to see use in specialized roles, particularly in naval and special operations forces.\
